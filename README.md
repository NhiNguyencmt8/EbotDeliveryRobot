# EbotDeliveryRobot
Ebot is a delivery robot that can pick up your bags and packages and then deliver them to your address. Its main function is to deliver, but in times of high demand for contactless delivery, Ebot must also carry the bags as fast as possible while still being careful.
This project is built for the RBE1001 in WPI.
